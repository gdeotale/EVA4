Problems Solved :
Write a code that draws this curve (without the arrows). In submission, you'll upload your drawn curve and code for that

Write a code which

uses this new ResNet Architecture for Cifar10:

PrepLayer - Conv 3x3 s1, p1) >> BN >> RELU [64k]

Layer1 -

 X = Conv 3x3 (s1, p1) >> MaxPool2D >> BN >> RELU [128k]
 
 R1 = ResBlock( (Conv-BN-ReLU-Conv-BN-ReLU))(X) [128k] 
 
 Add(X, R1)
Layer 2 -

 Conv 3x3 [256k]
 
 MaxPooling2D
 
 BN
 
 ReLU
Layer 3 -

 X = Conv 3x3 (s1, p1) >> MaxPool2D >> BN >> RELU [512k]
 
 R2 = ResBlock( (Conv-BN-ReLU-Conv-BN-ReLU))(X) [512k]
 
 Add(X, R2)
MaxPooling with Kernel Size 4

FC Layer

SoftMax

Uses One Cycle Policy such that:

Total Epochs = 24

Max at Epoch = 5

LRMIN = FIND

LRMAX = FIND

NO Annihilation

Uses this transform -RandomCrop 32, 32 (after padding of 4) >> FlipLR >> Followed by CutOut(8, 8)

Batch size = 512

Target Accuracy: 90%

Accuracy Achieved :
 89.96% in 24th Epoch. Used CyclicLR.
